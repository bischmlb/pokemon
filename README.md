### 🏗️ Tasks
- Create an API which will have the following features:
  - Basic authentication (You need to be logged in to add/edit/delete)
  - A list of paginated Pokemons (each item should contain: name, height, weight and image). The result should be:
    - sortable by name, height and weight;
    - filterable by name, height range and weight range.
  - The pagination should allow the clients to choose how many items are displayed on a page. Allowed values: 10, 20 and 50;
  - Ability to add/edit/delete custom Pokemons.
- Bonus points
  - Use GraphQL instead of REST endpoints
  - Use the Nest.js framework
